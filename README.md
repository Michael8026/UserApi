This project implements a secure user authentication system with email confirmation and access token management using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.

✨ Features
✅ User Registration
Users can register with a valid email and password.
A confirmation email is sent upon registration. (Still in development my smtp client is down for now ... but i created a confirmation API where you can manually confirm your email till the smtp client comes back online)

🔐 User Login
Registered users can log in using their email and password.
JWT tokens are issued upon successful login.

🔑 Access Token Generation
Authenticated users can generate 6-character alphanumeric access tokens.
Tokens are time-bound with an expiry date.
Tokens cannot be set to expire more than 3 days in the future.

✅ Access Token Verification
Validates token format and expiry.
Ensures the token was generated by the logged-in user.
